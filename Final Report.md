**Wholesale Customer Segmentation: A Data-Driven Analysis**



**Executive Summary**

Through a data-driven approach, four distinct customer segments were identified within the wholesale customer data. This segmentation provides a clear view of different purchasing behaviors, which can be leveraged for targeted business strategies.



**Cluster Insights**



**Cluster 0: Standard HoReCa Customers**



-Defining Characteristics: This segment is defined by its exclusive use of the HoReCa (Channel\_1 is 1.0) distribution channel. They have a high average spending on Fresh products. Their spending on Grocery and Detergents\_Paper is notably low compared to other segments.



-Business Interpretation: This group likely consists of smaller restaurants, cafes, or hotels that prioritize fresh ingredients but do not purchase large volumes of general retail goods.



**Cluster 1: Standard Retail Customers**



-Defining Characteristics: This segment is exclusively from the Retail channel (Channel\_2 is 1.0). Their purchasing habits are characterized by high average spending on Milk, Grocery, and Detergents\_Paper.



-Business Interpretation: This group represents typical retail outlets like small to medium-sized grocery stores that stock a wide range of products for general consumption.



**Cluster 2: High-Volume Retailers**



-Defining Characteristics: This is also a Retail segment (Channel\_2 is 1.0). However, it is distinguished by its extremely high average spending across all product categories, particularly on Milk (34,864.3), Grocery (46,126.1), and Detergents\_Paper (23,008.0).



-Business Interpretation: This segment represents the largest customers, likely major supermarkets or chains, that purchase in massive bulk. They are the company's highest-value customers by volume.



**Cluster 3: Specialty HoReCa Customers**



-Defining Characteristics: This segment is also in the HoReCa channel (Channel\_1 is 1.0). They have the highest average spending on Fresh (60,571.6) and exceptionally high spending on Delicassen (20,700.6) and Frozen (38,049.3).



-Business Interpretation: This small, high-value segment likely consists of specialty restaurants or upscale dining establishments that require large quantities of high-end, fresh, and frozen goods.



**Business Implications**

-Targeted Marketing: The business can create specific marketing campaigns for each cluster. For example, promoting bulk discounts to "High-Volume Retailers" (Cluster 2) or showcasing seasonal and high-end products to "Specialty HoReCa Customers" (Cluster 3).



-Customer Relationship Management: "High-Volume Retailers" and "Specialty HoReCa Customers" are the company's most profitable segments. They should be assigned dedicated account managers to ensure a strong relationship and retention.



-Product Strategy: The company could develop tailored product bundles for each segment. For example, offering a "standard restaurant starter pack" to "Standard HoReCa Customers" (Cluster 0) with a mix of fresh and basic supplies.
